# RuneQuest Random Character Generator

Version: 3.01
Author: Peter Keel <seegras@discordia.ch>

RuneQuest(TM) Character Generator. Primarily thought as aid for 
gamemasters to help them to create non-player characters.

You can use the "-r" switch to generate characters using my own
houserules. They consist mainly of seperating size from weight.

This Program underlies the GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0. 
See file COPYING for details.

The newest version should also be available on my homepage at 
https://seegras.discordia.ch 

Also, I'm working on localisation. A Future version should
support english and german output.
